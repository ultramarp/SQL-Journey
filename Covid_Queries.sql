--Now let's make the same exercise but with population, Cases Vs Population

-- Yeah yeah...i know, i'm also bothered that this dataset states that america has 2 continents.

--Now lets's check the Total Population vs Vaccinations
-- and include the percentage of Population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine
