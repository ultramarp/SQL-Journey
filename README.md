# SQL-Journey

## About

So, as i mentioned in my about page back in my [portfolio](https://github.com/ultramarp/data_analysis_portfolio) page, even though i am a tech enthusiast, i was overwhelmed by the amount of things you need to learn to become a good data scientist, so thanks to some books and of course...youtube "gurus", i followed some good advice and started studying one thing at a time choosing SQL to be that first coding experience.

Here you will find all my study and project material related to my learning process.
